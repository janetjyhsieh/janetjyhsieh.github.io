## About Me

I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Master's in Computer Science where I was fortunate to have been advised by [Nihar Shah](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nihars) and [Aditi Raghunathan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aditirag/). Prior to that, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science where I was fortunate to be advised by [Virginia Smith](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~smithv/#) and [Tian Li](https://litian96.github.io) for my senior thesis.

## Research Interests

I'm interested in pursuing responsible AI designs in three ways: (1) the safety and fairness of AI models and their down-stream deployments, (2) beneficial human-AI collaboration, and (3) technical AI governance.

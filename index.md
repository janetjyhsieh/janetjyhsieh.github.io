## About Me

I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Master's in Computer Science where I was fortunate to have been advised by [Nihar Shah](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nihars) and [Aditi Raghunathan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aditirag/). Prior to that, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science where I was fortunate to be advised by [Virginia Smith](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~smithv/#) and [Tian Li](https://litian96.github.io) for my senior thesis.

## Research Interests

My research goal is to ensure such social-technical systems are responsible, fair, and diverse. I am interested in investigating two connected aspects of human-AI interaction: (i) measuring and mitigating social-technical harms, and (ii) alignment of AI models with diverse human values. 

In addition to answering foundational questions, I am very passionate about studying real societal applications such as metascience, hiring decisions, combating misinformation, and healthcare. I would also like to think about how my research can inform policy.
